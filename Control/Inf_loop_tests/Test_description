Observed failure modes

-Overshoot after while in general -> find root cause!(check roll attitude before turn, maybe this has effect on turn) 
-Analyse ststistics about turn errors
-Missed turn (due to small gate problem, changed min_gate_ratio from 0.3 to 0.4)
-Turn overshoot after a while, when predictive speed is used in AHRS -> check predicted speed
